            <section id="newspaper">
                <div class="news">
                    <p>It all started when I was trying to take photos of some rings I made. I would make rings from metal on the lathe, then I would want a way to take photos of them and make it look professional. So, naturally, I took my fathers's DSLR and started taking photos. This happened to be a Nikon D800, which he had some macro lenses for it. So, I decided to make a makeshift lightbox to shoot my rings. Here is a photo of some of the rings I had worked on:</p>

                    <p class="quote">Two Damascas Steel Rings in the Lightbox</p>
                    <p>I would then move on from what some would consider 'product' photography. I decided to go outside the box (pun intended); I went outside to take photos of my animals. I am particularly fond of this photo of my cat. This cat was very dear to me, and still holds a place in my heart. I went outside, put the camera on Program mode and just went along to shoot some photos. I hadn't gotten the results I had liked. This is when I would begin taking more elaborate photos. </p>

                <div class="news second">
                    <p>Especially when I was asked to take photos of people, I couldn't find what the issue was. It wasn't until I graduated highschool and moved to Georgia that I regained the determination to pick up that DSLR again. I was bored out of my mind when we moved into our house. I had no job, nothing to do all day, so naturally I took up photography to fill my time.                     </p>
                    <p>Focusing on the composition of the photos more, looking into different modes. I had learned a LOT in that time. What looked good, what didn't look so good, and all the inbetween. Now, this is a learning process, for sure, because I am still learning how to take shots that I like. I am always open to learning more. To taking more advice and understanding more about the camera, the composition, what lens to use.                     </p>

                        <h3>Car Show in Rexburg</h3>
                        <p>This was when I went to a car-show in Rexburg, Idaho. Where I reside for school. I was drawn to the show by a Facebook post in a group. It was an absolute blast to see the cars there. It certainly was small, but it was mighty. There were some really cool cars, one of which I shot the interior of. A Nissan 300ZX. It caught my eye immediately, this generation of Japanese cars were iconic. I took this photo and I love the composition of it as well as the clarity.</p>

                        <h3>The Fruits of my Boredom</h3>
                        <p>There is a certain pain that comes from boredom. The human brain will do whatever it can to relieve this pain, in my case this relief manifested itself in photography. As stated earlier in the page, I had spent some time in a new home with no one to talk to or anything to do. With the job search being so lackluster, I took upon myself the task of photography. This is the first shot I had taken that I was proud of. The composition felt right, there was a nice haze coming from the light of the window. It is almost as if you can feel the warmth in this photo. I was quite proud of this shot, which isn't very impressive to anyone. It was my windowsill, what I saw when I woke up. It is a weirdly nostalgic feeling seeing this photo. </p>
